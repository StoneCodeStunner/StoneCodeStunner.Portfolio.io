        Hi! I am Leland a Software Engineer from Houston County Tennessee. I've
        done some neat things with Html/Css and JavaScript such as making a
        period crawl across words and land at .com. Also, I coded a rocket that
        made me feel on top of the world. I think solving problems with others
        as a team is amazing because no one is the same and putting your minds
        together can solve problems faster than what one person could do alone.
        I can't wait to have a good team to build with. To create applications
        that our clients will love for years to come. Outside of coding I love
        to play guitar and write music. Going to the creek with friends and
        family. Grilling good food and having great family time watching movies
        with the kids. I want to provide my clients with great frontend to
        backend coding. Also, a great mind to solve an issue and build great
        applications that I'm proud of. To make them proud to have my as
        Software Engineer.
